          I'm interested in everything, with very few exceptions. I write and read science fiction, fantasy, and anything speculative. I speak enough languages for half my fingers, have enough books to found a small library, and love to talk about ideas. I love the natural world, and go out in it as often as possible.

          This portfolio will contain many of the works I produce during my time at the <a href="https://bootcamp.cps.gwu.edu/coding/">GW Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp</a>.  You can find my projects in the <a href="portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> tab above; feel free also to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/laraek">Github</a> for more.  I'm also available professionally on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lara-ek/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://angel.co/lara-ek">AngelList</a>.  If you feel like you would like to reach out ot me professionally, please do not hesitate to do so. 
          <br/>

          In the meantime, as I do not yet have any projects to share, please feel free to look at my writing.  I've got a few short stories and a poem published.  Feel free to head on over to my <a href="writing.html">Writing Page</a> to learn more, or to visit my Author Pages on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lara-Ek/e/B01N4F2TQD">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5441095.Lara_Ek">Goodreads</a>.
